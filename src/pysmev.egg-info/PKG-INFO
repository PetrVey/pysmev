=================
PySMEV
=================

PySMEV contains a set of methods to apply the Simplified Metastatistical Extreme Value analysis as presented in:

Francesco Marra. (2020). A Unified Framework for Extreme Sub-daily Precipitation Frequency Analyses based on Ordinary Events - data & codes (Versione v1). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971558


The scripts were tested on data coming from:

Dallan, E., & Marra, F. (2022). Enhanced summer convection explains observed trends in extreme subdaily precipitation in the Eastern Italian Alps - Codes & data (Versione v1). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6088848

Installation
------------
For the moment the package is not available on pypi, so you need to install it from the source code.
To do so, clone the repository and run the following command in the root folder of the repository.
  
With Conda 

.. code-block:: bash

    # create pysmev environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    # activate pysmev environment
    conda activate pysmev_env
    # install pytenax in editable mode
    python -m pip install -e .



Usage
-----

For a complete example of how to use the class, please see the file `example_smev_1h_obs.py` in the `example` folder.


Development
-----------
To build a development environment run:

With Conda 

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate pysmev_env
    python -m pip install -e .


Please work on a feature branch and create a pull request to the source branch.
To ensure formatting consistency, please install the pre-commit hooks by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

If necessary to merge manually do so without fast forward:

.. code-block:: bash

    git merge --no-ff myfeature
