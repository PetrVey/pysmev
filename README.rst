| **pySMEV repository also includes:**
| *2) A test for the hypothesis: block maxima are samples from a parent distribution with Weibull tail*
| The test is described in:

Installation
------------
For the moment the package is not available on pypi, so you need to install it from the source code.
To do so, clone the repository and run the following command in the root folder of the repository.
  
With Conda 

.. code-block:: bash

    # create pysmev environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    # activate pysmev environment
    conda activate pysmev_env
    # install pytenax in editable mode
    python -m pip install -e .



Usage
-----

For a complete example of how to use the class, please see the files in the `example` folder:


Development
-----------
To build a development environment run:

With Conda 

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate pysmev_env
    python -m pip install -e .


Please work on a feature branch and create a pull request to the source branch.
To ensure formatting consistency, please install the pre-commit hooks by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

If necessary to merge manually do so without fast forward:

.. code-block:: bash

    git merge --no-ff myfeature
